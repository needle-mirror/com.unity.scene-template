# Scene Template

The scene template mechanism allows a user to customize how new scene are created from within the Unity Editor. Instead of creating a *boring* semi-empty scene (with a Camera a Directional Light) you get to setup different scenes that are then used as template when creating new scene. You can even specify that some of the scene template dependencies need to be cloned on scene instancing.
